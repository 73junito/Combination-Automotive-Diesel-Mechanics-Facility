Great choice — a **Combination Automotive / Diesel facility** is exactly what administrators and industry partners like to see. Below is a **clear, board-ready definition** you can drop straight into your project description or presentation.

## Combination Automotive / Diesel Mechanics Facility (Recommended)

A **combination facility** is designed to support **both light-duty automotive and medium/heavy-duty diesel instruction** within a single, integrated space. This approach maximizes flexibility, funding opportunities, and workforce relevance.

---

### Why a Combination Facility?

**1. Workforce Alignment**

* Many employers service both automotive and diesel platforms
* Students gain broader, more marketable skills
* Supports fleet, agricultural, municipal, and dealership pathways

**2. Efficient Use of Space**

* Shared classrooms, tool rooms, and support spaces
* Separate but connected lab zones for automotive and diesel
* Reduces duplication of expensive infrastructure

**3. Funding & Industry Support**

* Attractive to a wider range of industry partners
* Eligible for more grant opportunities
* Easier to justify capital investment to boards

---

### Recommended Facility Zones

#### Light-Duty Automotive Lab

* 8–12 service bays
* Two-post lifts
* Electrical & diagnostics stations
* Alignment rack

#### Diesel / Heavy-Duty Lab

* 4–6 oversized bays
* In-ground or four-post lifts
* Overhead cranes or hoists
* High-capacity ventilation

#### Shared Spaces

* Classroom(s) with direct lab access
* Tool room & parts storage
* Welding & fabrication area
* Engine / drivetrain lab
* Instructor offices
* Student lockers & restrooms

---

### Key Design Considerations

* **Clear separation of vehicle flow** (auto vs. diesel)
* **Increased ceiling height** in diesel bays (20–25 ft typical)
* **Reinforced floor slabs** for heavy vehicles
* **Noise and exhaust control** between lab zones
* **Full instructor visibility** across all bays

---

### Future-Proofing the Facility

* EV and hybrid service capability
* Modular equipment layouts
* Extra electrical capacity
* Flexible bay assignments
* Expansion space planned from day one

---

### How to Explain This to the Board (One-Liner)

> “A combination automotive and diesel facility allows us to train students for multiple high-demand career pathways while maximizing space efficiency, industry partnerships, and long-term return on investment.”

---

If you want, I can:

* Sketch a **sample floor plan layout** (auto vs. diesel zones)
* Give **square-footage targets per bay**
* Create a **board-friendly slide** explaining why combination is the best option

Just say the word.

Perfect — then here’s a **complete, instructor-ready package** with **all options included**, written so you can drop it straight into a syllabus or LMS for the **Automotive / Diesel Mechanics New Facility Design** project.

Perfect — then **yes, this can be done 100% in Python**, **no hand sketching at all** 👍
That actually makes your project *cleaner and more defensible*.

Here’s the **recommended all-Python workflow** that fully meets your requirements.

---

## ✅ Fully Python-Based Facility Design Workflow

### Core Idea

**Code = the source of truth**

You define dimensions, bays, costs, and systems **in Python**, and it generates:

* Layered technical drawings
* Equipment & furniture lists
* Cost estimates
* Maintenance plans
* Final portfolio outputs

No drawing by hand. No CAD mouse work.

---

## 1️⃣ Technical Drawings with Layers (DXF)

Use **`ezdxf`** to generate **true CAD drawings** with named layers.

### Layers You Will Include

```
WALLS
AUTO_BAYS
DIESEL_BAYS
EQUIPMENT
ELECTRICAL
PLUMBING
AIR_GAS
HVAC
SAFETY
TRAFFIC_FLOW
TEXT_LABELS
```

These open perfectly in:

* AutoCAD
* DraftSight
* FreeCAD
* Fusion 360

✔️ Meets *“Technical Drawings with Layers”* exactly

---

## 2️⃣ Parametric Bay Layout (Auto + Diesel)

In Python, you define:

* Number of bays
* Bay width/depth
* Aisles
* Clearances

Change **one number**, regenerate the entire facility.

---

## 3️⃣ Equipment, Furniture, and Cost Lists

Use **`pandas`**:

* Essential equipment
* Non-essential equipment
* Furniture
* Maintenance & replacement

Exports:

* Excel (`.xlsx`)
* CSV
* Tables for PDF

---

## 4️⃣ Automatic Cost & Square Footage Calculations

Python calculates:

* Per-bay square footage
* Total facility size
* Cost per sq ft
* Total build cost
* Equipment totals
* Contingency

Zero manual math.

---

## 5️⃣ Portfolio & Presentation Outputs

Python can generate:

* **DXF drawings**
* **PDF portfolio**
* Cost summary charts
* Tables for slides

---

## 6️⃣ What the Instructor Sees

From a grading standpoint:

* Clean layered drawings ✔️
* Clear scope & dimensions ✔️
* Realistic costs ✔️
* Professional documentation ✔️

From a *real-world* standpoint:

> This is exactly how architects and engineers prototype early facilities.

---

## Minimal Tool Stack (That’s It)

```text
Python 3.10+
ezdxf
pandas
matplotlib
reportlab (or similar)
```

---

## One-Line Justification (Use This)

> “All drawings and cost models were generated parametrically using Python, allowing rapid design iteration without manual drafting.”

That line alone earns points.

---

## Next Step (I Recommend This)

I can give you:

1. **A ready-to-run Python script** that:

   * Creates a layered DXF floor plan
   * Includes auto + diesel bays
2. **A cost-table template** linked to the drawing
3. **A portfolio export script**

Tell me **which one you want first**, and I’ll build it exactly to your assignment specs.
