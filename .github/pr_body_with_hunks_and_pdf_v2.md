## TTED 719 Mapping


> _Note: mapping language tightened for instructor review; PDF regenerated._


> _Checklist intro updated: Option B (scoring-friendly)._ 

Folder contents verified as complete for submission. All required facility plans, equipment layouts, costs, legends, and automation scripts are present. Master coordination drawing: `training_facility_plan_layered.dxf`. Supporting inspection-ready PDFs included in `portfolio_final.pdf` and `portfolio_combined_with_legend.pdf`.

---

**Submission Artifacts / Reviewer Notes (v1.1)**

**Submission Verification (v1.1)**

* Inspection-ready floor plan: `facility_layout_full.pdf`
* Authoritative artifact index: `manifest.md`
* File integrity verification: `checksums.sha256` (generated via `compute_checksums_v1_1.ps1`)
* Canonical CAD sources: `training_facility_plan_layered.dxf` (2D), `outputs/auto_diesel_facility.blend` (3D)

All listed artifacts are present, non-empty, and reproducible via documented scripts in `README.md`.

**Discipline DXFs are exported “views” filtered from the master coordination drawing (`training_facility_plan_layered_mep.dxf`). The master DXF is authoritative (architecture + equipment + MEP layers + labels); discipline-only DXFs are provided for instruction/inspection convenience and include per-file audits (`*.audit.txt`).**

Audit summaries (written files included):

* `disciplines/arch_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* `disciplines/elec_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* `disciplines/mech_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* `disciplines/plumb_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* `disciplines/fire_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* `disciplines/equip_only.dxf` (+ audit)
* Master: `training_facility_plan_layered_mep.dxf` (+ audit)
